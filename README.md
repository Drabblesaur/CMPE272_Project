Preliminary idea, subject to change:

**Backend API Generator for Database - Low Code**

Objective: User specifies the database (DB) and code framework, and the application generates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs as well as custom APIs based on project needs, handling the DB data seamlessly.

Novelty: The platform provides a low-code interface where users can visually configure database connections, define data models, and customize API endpoints without writing code. Implement AI-driven recommendations for API optimizations based on the structure and use cases of the database.

Enterprise use: Enables rapid development and deployment of database-driven applications, reduces the need for extensive backend development expertise, 

- accelerates time-to-market for enterprise solutions by simplifying the creation and management of APIs.
