# Description

This project is a service that generates API CRUD ( Create, Read, Update, Delete) and Custom APIs to interact with a user’s existing Database. All the user needs to do is specify the Database and its schemas, the code framework, and if the user wants a Custom API route, the description of what the route does.

The platform provides a low-code interface where users can visually configure database connections, define data models, and customize API endpoints without writing code. Implement AI-driven recommendations for API optimizations based on the structure and use cases of the database.

Enterprise use: Enables rapid development and deployment of database-driven applications, reduces the need for extensive backend development expertise,

- accelerates time-to-market for enterprise solutions by simplifying the creation and management of APIs.

# Use Case Personas
Persona #1: Full-Stack Developer at a SaaS Startup
A full-stack developer frequently builds APIs to interact with databases, and need a faster solution to keep up with the startup’s pace. Using the low-code interface, they can set up API endpoints in minutes and defins custom routes based on feature requests. The AI recommendations suggest how to optimize these routes for common performance bottlenecks based on similar use cases.

Persona #2: Lone Frontend Developer
Complex websites are hard to develop with just a lone frontend developer. Using the site, they can quickly spinup API for their backend.
