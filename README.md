# Db2API (CMPE 272 Project)

# Description

This project is a service that generates API CRUD ( Create, Read, Update, Delete) and Custom APIs to interact with a userâ€™s existing Database. All the user needs to do is specify the Database and its schemas, the code framework, and if the user wants a Custom API route, the description of what the route does.

The platform provides a low-code interface where users can visually configure database connections, define data models, and customize API endpoints without writing code. Implement AI-driven recommendations for API optimizations based on the structure and use cases of the database.

Enterprise use: Enables rapid development and deployment of database-driven applications, reduces the need for extensive backend development expertise,

- accelerates time-to-market for enterprise solutions by simplifying the creation and management of APIs.
