Preliminary idea, subject to change:

**AI-Enabled Enterprise Document Summarizer**

**Objective:** Create an AI platform that automatically summarizes lengthy enterprise documents (such as meeting notes, reports, and contracts) into concise, actionable insights using NLP techniques. This solution will help stakeholders quickly grasp key information without sifting through extensive documents.

**Novelty:** Integrate the summarizer with enterprise chatbots, allowing employees to query the system for real-time, contextual document summaries and quick answers. This integration enhances user engagement by providing personalized, immediate responses within familiar communication channels.

**Enterprise Use:** Improves efficiency in handling large volumes of information in daily operations. By streamlining information access, it enables employees to focus on critical tasks and make informed decisions more swiftly.
